# Story Generation Instructions Expansion

## Overview

Expanded the default search instructions prompt to encourage AI models to return a **much wider variety of stories** with diverse perspectives, sources, and ratings.

## Changes Made

### File Modified

- **`lib/store.ts`** (lines 227-246)

### Before (Original)

The original prompt was minimal and generic:

- Basic instruction to search for recent news
- Simple JSON format specification
- No guidance on diversity, sources, or rating criteria
- ~13 lines total

### After (Enhanced)

The new prompt is comprehensive and detailed:

- **~40 lines** with extensive guidance
- Detailed diversity requirements
- Clear story selection criteria
- Specific rating guidelines (1-10 scale)
- Multiple story type examples
- Source variety requirements

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **Diversity Requirements**

```
DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Include stories from MULTIPLE sources (mainstream, niche, independent, international)
- Mix different story types: breaking news, analysis, opinion pieces, investigative reports, feature stories
- Vary significance ratings (1-10) based on true impact - not all stories should be 7-8
- Use diverse categories that accurately reflect content
- Include different perspectives and viewpoints on the topic
- Find both popular stories AND lesser-known but significant coverage
```

**Why?** Encourages the AI to search beyond just the top 3-5 mainstream sources and find unique perspectives.

### 2. **Story Selection Criteria**

```
STORY SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Prioritize RECENCY: Only stories from the last 24 hours
- Seek VARIETY: Don't just return mainstream sources
- Value SIGNIFICANCE: Rate based on actual impact and importance
- Ensure ACCURACY: Verify dates, sources, and URLs are real
```

**Why?** Gives the AI clear priorities to balance recency with variety and accuracy.

### 3. **Rating Guidelines (1-10 Scale)**

```
RATING GUIDELINES (1-10):
- 9-10: Major breaking news with global impact
- 7-8: Significant developments, industry-shaping news
- 5-6: Notable stories, moderate importance
- 3-4: Minor updates, niche interest
- 1-2: Small mentions, very limited impact
```

**Why?** Without guidelines, AI models tend to rate everything 6-8. This encourages a true distribution from 1-10 based on actual impact.

### 4. **Enhanced Category Examples**

```
"category": "Technology|Business|Politics|Science|Health|Entertainment|Sports|World|Opinion|Analysis|etc."
```

**Why?** Shows the AI that categories should be diverse and specific, not just generic "Technology" or "News".

### 5. **Improved Summary Guidance**

```
"summary": "2-3 sentence summary focusing on key facts and significance"
```

**Why?** Encourages more detailed, fact-focused summaries rather than single-sentence descriptions.

## Expected Results

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, revert by replacing the prompt with:

```typescript
searchInstructions: `Search for recent news about this keyword.

Return ONLY this exact JSON format (no extra text or fields):
{
  "stories": [
    {
      "title": "Headline",
      "category": "Technology",
      "rating": 7,
      "summary": "Brief summary",
      "source": "Source name",
      "url": "https://...",
      "date": "2025-10-16"
    }
  ]
}

If no news found, return: {"stories": []}

Keyword:`,
```

## Conclusion

This enhancement transforms the News Report Generator from returning **basic search results** to generating **comprehensive, diverse, multi-perspective news reports** that provide real value to users seeking a broad understanding of any topic.

The expanded instructions leverage AI capabilities to act more like a **skilled news curator** rather than a simple search aggregator.
