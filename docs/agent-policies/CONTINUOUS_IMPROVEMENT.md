# 🔄 Continuous Improvement Protocol

**Purpose:** Systematic process for identifying, proposing, and implementing technical debt reduction and process enhancements.

**Mandate:** Agents MUST actively look for improvement opportunities during all work.

---

## 🎯 Overview

### The Continuous Improvement Mandate

**Core Principle:**

> During planning and implementation, the agent MUST actively look for opportunities to reduce unnecessary technical debt, improve testing (coverage/speed/clarity), or optimize development flow.

**Scope Boundary:**

- **In-scope:** Improvements directly related to current work
- **Out-of-scope:** Improvements requiring separate issue

**Action Required:**

- **Can handle safely under Mode 0.5** → Implement immediately
- **Outside current issue scope or Mode 0.5** → Draft new issue proposal

---

## 📋 Types of Improvements

### 1. Code Quality Improvements

**Examples:**

- Dead code removal
- Duplicated logic extraction
- Type safety enhancement
- Naming clarity improvements
- Comment/documentation gaps

**Threshold for Immediate Action (Mode 0.5):**

```typescript
// ✅ Can do immediately in Mode 0.5:
// Remove 3 unused imports (8 lines, 1 file)
- import { unusedFunction } from './utils';  // DELETE
- import { anotherUnused } from './helpers';  // DELETE

// ❌ Requires separate issue:
// Extract shared validation logic across 6 files (200 lines, 6 files)
// → Too large for Mode 0.5, propose as new issue
```

---

### 2. Testing Improvements

**Examples:**

- Missing edge case tests
- Slow test optimization
- Flaky test fixes
- Test clarity improvements
- Coverage gaps

**Threshold for Immediate Action (Mode 0.5):**

```typescript
// ✅ Can do immediately:
// Add missing null check test (12 lines, 1 file)
it('should handle null user gracefully', () => {
  expect(getUsername(null)).toBe('Anonymous');
});

// ❌ Requires separate issue:
// Implement integration test suite for API module
// → Significant new work, propose as new issue
```

---

### 3. Performance Optimizations

**Examples:**

- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) → O(n))
- Missing memoization
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Bundle size bloat
- Database query optimization

**Threshold for Immediate Action:**

```typescript
// ✅ Can do immediately if noticed during work:
// Add useMemo to expensive computation (5 lines)
const filtered = useMemo(() => items.filter(item => item.active), [items]);

// ❌ Requires separate issue:
// Refactor entire component tree for React.memo
// → Architectural change, propose as new issue
```

---

### 4. Developer Experience (DX)

**Examples:**

- Confusing error messages
- Missing logging/debugging hooks
- Unclear variable names
- Missing type definitions
- Poor API ergonomics

**Threshold for Immediate Action:**

```typescript
// ✅ Can do immediately:
// Improve error message clarity (3 lines)
- throw new Error('Invalid input');
+ throw new Error(`Invalid email format: ${email}. Expected format: user@domain.com`);

// ❌ Requires separate issue:
// Redesign API to be more intuitive
// → Breaking change, propose as new issue
```

---

### 5. Security Enhancements

**Examples:**

- Input validation gaps
- XSS vulnerability fixes
- SQL injection prevention
- Secrets exposure risks
- Dependency vulnerabilities

**Special Rule:**

```
🚨 SECURITY ISSUES REQUIRE IMMEDIATE MODE 4 FREEZE
→ Do NOT fix yourself
→ Switch to Mode 4
→ Flag for security team
→ Document vulnerability location and risk
```

---

## 🔍 Identification Process

### During Planning (Step 2 of Workflow)

**Ask These Questions:**

1. **Code Quality:**
   - Is there dead/commented code nearby?
   - Are there duplicated patterns?
   - Is typing loose (any, unknown)?

2. **Testing:**
   - Are there untested edge cases?
   - Are tests slow or flaky?
   - Is coverage <80% in this module?

3. **Performance:**
   - Are there obvious inefficiencies?
   - Missing memoization opportunities?
   - Expensive operations in render loops?

4. **DX:**
   - Are error messages helpful?
   - Is logging sufficient for debugging?
   - Are names clear and consistent?

5. **Security:**
   - Is user input validated?
   - Are there injection risks?
   - Are secrets hardcoded?

---

### During Implementation (Step 3 of Workflow)

**Active Monitoring:**

```typescript
// While implementing fix for Issue #123:

// ✅ GOOD: Notice opportunity
// Current code:
const users = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'`);
//                                                              ^^^^^^^ SQL INJECTION RISK!

// Action: Flag immediately (Mode 4 - Security)

// ✅ GOOD: Notice improvement
// Current code (nearby, not part of Issue #123):
const formatDate = d => {
  /* unused function */
};
const formatTime = t => {
  /* unused function */
};

// Action: Create Mode 0.5 cleanup or propose new issue
```

---

### During Verification (Step 6 of Workflow)

**Final Sweep:**

```markdown
## Technical Debt Review Checklist

**Code I touched:**

- [ ] No new technical debt introduced
- [ ] Existing debt reduced (if safely possible)
- [ ] No obvious smells left behind

**Related Code (nearby):**

- [ ] Identified improvement opportunities
- [ ] Classified as: Immediate fix OR New issue proposal

**Systemic Issues:**

- [ ] Noted any architectural roadblocks
- [ ] Flagged for PQA issue creation (if major)
```

---

## 📝 Proposal Format

### New Issue Proposal Template

**Include in PR Body:**

```markdown
## 💡 New Issue Proposals (Technical Debt Identified)

### Proposal 1: <Short, Descriptive Title>

**Scope:** <1-2 lines describing the change>

**Justification:** <Why this matters - performance, maintainability, security, etc.>

**Estimated Complexity:** <Low/Medium/High> (<X> lines, <Y> files estimated)

**Mode Required:** <Mode 0 or Mode 3>

**Suggested Priority:** <P1/P2/P3>

**Estimated Effort:** <X> hours

**Evidence:** <Link to code location, metrics, or examples>

---

### Proposal 2: <Another Title>

<Same structure...>

---

**Note:** These improvements were identified during work on Issue #<NUM> but NOT implemented in this PR to maintain scope. Requesting human review/triage for prioritization.
```

---

### Example Proposals

#### Example 1: Performance Improvement

```markdown
### Proposal 1: Optimize User Search with Debouncing

**Scope:** Add 300ms debounce to user search input to reduce API calls

**Justification:** Current implementation fires API request on every keystroke,
causing ~500 unnecessary requests/minute during peak usage. Debouncing would
reduce to ~50 requests/minute, improving server load and user experience.

**Estimated Complexity:** Low (15 lines, 1 file)

**Mode Required:** Mode 0 (application code only)

**Suggested Priority:** P2 (Performance improvement, not critical)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

**Evidence:**

- Current code: src/components/UserSearch.tsx:42-58
- Network tab shows 8 requests for "john" (j, jo, joh, john, ...)
- Backend logs show 500 req/min avg during business hours
```

---

#### Example 2: Testing Gap

```markdown
### Proposal 2: Add Error Path Tests for Authentication Module

**Scope:** Add unit tests for error scenarios in src/auth/login.ts

**Justification:** During bug fix for #123, noticed auth module has 85% coverage
but missing tests for critical error paths (network failure, invalid token,
expired session). These scenarios cause 40% of production auth issues per logs.

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium (80 lines, 2 files - login.test.ts, setup.ts)

**Mode Required:** Mode 0 (test files only)

**Suggested Priority:** P2 (Improve reliability, prevent regressions)

**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours

**Evidence:**

- Coverage report: src/auth/login.ts shows untested branches
- Production logs (last 30d): 127 auth errors, 52 from untested paths
- Sentry: https://sentry.io/issues/AUTH-ERROR-GROUP-123
```

---

#### Example 3: Major Systemic Flaw

```markdown
### Proposal 3: Refactor Shared Mutable State in Auth Module

**Scope:** Refactor auth module to eliminate shared mutable state causing race conditions

**Justification:** During implementation of Issue #123, discovered that multiple
components mutate `globalAuthState` directly, causing race conditions when
logging in/out rapidly. This is a deep architectural flaw blocking clean
implementation of session refresh logic. Requires context-based state or Zustand.

**Estimated Complexity:** High (400 lines, 8 files - full auth module refactor)

**Mode Required:** Mode 3 (may need dependency addition for state management)

**Suggested Priority:** P1 (Blocking feature work, causes production bugs)

**Estimated Effort:** 16-24 hours (2-3 days)

**Evidence:**

- Current code: src/auth/state.ts (global mutable object)
- Consumers: 8 components directly mutate state
- Production bug: Issue #118 (race condition during logout)
- Blocker for: Issue #234 (session refresh feature)

**Roadblock Details:**
This issue BLOCKED clean implementation of Issue #123. Had to implement
workaround with polling instead of proper event-driven state updates.

## 🎯 Implementation Workflow

### Option 1: Immediate Fix (Mode 0.5)

**When:**

- ≤50 lines, ≤2 files
- No logic changes
- app/src/tests files only
- Clearly beneficial

**Process:**

1. **Announce Mode Switch:**

   ```markdown
   ## Mode 0.5 Declaration

   **Type:** Self-Initiated Refactor
   **Trigger:** Identified dead code during Issue #123 implementation
   **Scope:** Remove 3 unused utility functions from src/utils/date.ts
   **Benefit:** Reduce bundle size ~1.2KB, improve code maintainability
   **Est Diff:** 47 lines, 1 file (Budget: 50L/2F ✅)
   ```

2. **Make Changes**

3. **Commit Separately:**

   ```bash
   git add src/utils/date.ts
   git commit -m "refactor: remove unused date utilities

   Mode: 0.5 (Self-Initiated)
   Cleanup benefit: Removed formatDateLong, formatDateShort, parseISODate
   that haven't been used in 8+ months (per git blame). Reduces bundle size
   by ~1.2KB and cognitive load.
   Impact: src/utils/date.ts (47 lines removed)"
   ```

4. **Include in Same PR:**
   - Two commits: Main fix + Refactor
   - Explain in PR body

---

### Option 2: New Issue Proposal (Larger Improvement)

**When:**

- > 50 lines or >2 files
- Logic changes required
- Architecture changes
- Dependency additions
- Requires Mode 3

**Process:**

1. **Draft Proposal** (use template above)

2. **Add to PR Body:**

   ```markdown
   ## 💡 New Issue Proposals

   [Paste proposal here]
   ```

3. **Continue with Original Issue:**
   - Do NOT implement the improvement
   - Stay focused on original scope

4. **Human Reviews & Triages:**
   - Approves proposal → Creates new issue
   - Adjusts priority
   - Assigns to backlog

---

### Option 3: Major Systemic Flaw (PQA Issue)

**When:**

- Deep architectural problem
- Blocking feature work severely
- Causes production bugs
- Requires significant refactor (>300 lines)

**Process:**

1. **Create Detailed PQA Proposal:**

   ```markdown
   ### Proposal: Refactor Auth Module State Management (PQA)

   **Type:** Process/Quality/Architecture Issue

   **Severity:** P1 (Blocks features, causes prod bugs)

   **Problem Statement:**
   Auth module uses shared mutable global state, causing race conditions
   and blocking clean implementation of session refresh, logout, and
   multi-tab support.

   **Impact:**

   - Blocks: Issues #234, #245, #256 (session features)
   - Causes: ~15 prod bugs/month (race conditions)
   - Workarounds: 3 issues implemented with polling instead of events

   **Root Cause:**
   Initial implementation (2023-05) used simple global object. As features
   grew, global mutation by 8+ components created unmaintainable state.

   **Proposed Solution:**
   Refactor to React Context + useReducer OR Zustand for predictable state.

   **Estimated Effort:** 16-24 hours (2-3 days)
   **Files Affected:** 8 files in src/auth/

   **Evidence:**

   - Current Issue #123 blocked by this
   - Production bugs: #118, #167, #201 (all race conditions)
   - Sentry error group: AUTH-RACE-CONDITION (127 occurrences/month)
   ```

2. **Link in Current PR:**

   ```markdown
   ## ⚠️ Architectural Roadblock Identified

   During implementation, discovered deep systemic issue blocking clean solution.
   Created separate PQA issue proposal (see above) for prioritization.

   **Current PR:** Implements workaround using polling to unblock immediate need.
   **Long-term:** Recommend addressing systemic issue per proposal.
   ```

3. **Human Team Triages:**
   - Evaluates proposal
   - Creates dedicated planning issue
   - Schedules architectural refactor

## 🎓 Best Practices

### DO ✅

- **Always look for improvements** during every issue
- **Document all findings** (even if not implementing)
- **Prioritize honestly** (P1 for true blockers, P3 for nice-to-haves)
- **Provide evidence** (metrics, logs, links)
- **Estimate realistically** (better to over-estimate)
- **Focus on impact** (not just "clean code" aesthetics)

### DON'T ❌

- **Don't implement large improvements** without proposal
- **Don't inflate priority** to get your proposal picked
- **Don't propose vague improvements** ("make code better")
- **Don't skip evidence** (no "I think this could be faster")
- **Don't ignore security issues** (always Mode 4 freeze)
- **Don't scope creep** the current PR
