## üö® Mode 3 Override Request Template

**When to use:** Before touching runtime deps, root configs, or files outside Mode 0/1/2 allowlists.

```markdown
üö® OVERRIDE REQUEST (Mode 3 ‚Äî Scoped)

Issue: #<NUM> ‚Äî <TITLE>
Base ref: <ref/branch>

Why override is needed (‚â§5 lines):
- [What's blocked, by what constraint, and why lesser modes are insufficient]

Options considered:
1) <Option A: minimal scope> ‚Äî Pros/Cons, Est lines/files, Risk
2) <Option B: alt> ‚Äî Pros/Cons, Est lines/files, Risk
3) <Option C: do nothing> ‚Äî Impact

Proposed plan (chosen option):
- Paths touched (exact, must be saved to PROPOSED_FILES.txt): [files]
- Est diff: ~<lines>, <files> (Note: Diff budget applies to code/text; non-text assets are reviewed case-by-case)
- **Dependency change:** [npm install/update/remove, or N/A]
- **Security/License Check:** [brief summary of security review or N/A]
- **Versioning Preference:** [State preference: Caret (^), Tilde (~), or Pinned version]
- Rollback: `git revert <sha>` (single commit)
- Tests added: [file]
- Timebox: <N> hours

Evidence pack:
- Repro commands + outputs (tsc/test/build)
- Exact failing lines (file:line)
- Links (logs/builds)

APPROVAL NEEDED:
Reply with: **APPROVE OVERRIDE: Mode 3 (Option X)** and I'll proceed.
```

### Example - Filled Template

```markdown
üö® OVERRIDE REQUEST (Mode 3 ‚Äî Scoped)

Issue: #456 ‚Äî Add image optimization for product gallery
Base ref: main

Why override is needed (‚â§5 lines):
- Product gallery requires WebP conversion and CDN integration
- Needs `next-image-optimizer` runtime dependency
- Must modify `next.config.ts` to configure image domains
- Cannot be solved with Mode 0 (root config restriction)

Options considered:
1) Add next-image-optimizer + modify next.config.ts ‚Äî Fast, proven solution. ~85 lines, 3 files. Low risk (well-documented).
2) Build custom image pipeline ‚Äî More control but ~400 lines, 8 files. High complexity, weeks of work.
3) Use external service (Cloudinary) ‚Äî Zero code but monthly cost + vendor lock-in.

Proposed plan (chosen option #1):
- Paths touched (exact, must be saved to PROPOSED_FILES.txt):
  - next.config.ts
  - package.json
  - package-lock.json
  - src/components/ProductGallery.tsx
- Est diff: ~85 lines, 3 files (lockfile excluded from count)
- **Dependency change:** npm install next-image-optimizer@^2.1.0
- **Security/License Check:** MIT license, 0 CVEs, actively maintained (last release 2 weeks ago)
- **Versioning Preference:** Caret (^) - allow patch/minor updates
- Rollback: `git revert <sha>` (single commit)
- Tests added: tests/components/ProductGallery.test.tsx
- Timebox: 3 hours

Evidence pack:
- Repro: Current images load as raw PNG (3.2MB each), lighthouse score 45/100
- Current ProductGallery.tsx:142-156 uses <img> instead of <Image>
- Build logs: https://vercel.com/build/abc123
- Next.js docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image

APPROVAL NEEDED:
Reply with: **APPROVE OVERRIDE: Mode 3 (Option 1)** and I'll proceed.
```

## üí¨ Commit Message Templates

### Standard Commit (Mode 0)

```
fix: <short-name> (Fixes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>)

Mode: 0
RCA: <3-5 line root cause analysis>
Minimal fix: <1-2 line description of the change>
Tests: <test file path>
```

**Example:**
```
fix: login validation bypass (Fixes #789)

Mode: 0
RCA: The email validation regex in src/auth/validator.ts was not escaping
special characters, allowing emails like "admin@[localhost]" to bypass
validation. This occurred because the regex used String() instead of escaping
input, enabling potential XSS via crafted email addresses.
Minimal fix: Added regex escaping via escapeRegex() helper in validator.ts.
Tests: tests/auth/validator.test.ts
```

### Refactor Commit (Mode 0.5)

```
refactor: <short-name>

Mode: 0.5 (Self-Initiated)
Cleanup benefit: <1-2 line justification>
Impact: <affected files/functions>
```

**Example:**
```
refactor: remove unused utility functions

Mode: 0.5 (Self-Initiated)
Cleanup benefit: Removed 3 unused date formatting helpers (last used 8mo ago
per git blame), reducing bundle size by ~1.2KB and cognitive load.
Impact: src/utils/date.ts, src/utils/format.ts (45 lines removed)
```

### LTRM Commit (Mode 1)

```
fix: <short-name> (Fixes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>)

Mode: 1 (LTRM)
RCA: <3-5 line root cause analysis of tooling failure>
Minimal fix: <1-2 line description>
Tests: <test file path>
```

**Example:**
```
fix: jest unable to parse TypeScript (Fixes #234)

Mode: 1 (LTRM)
RCA: Jest was failing with "SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'" when
running tests. Root cause: jest.config.js was missing the ts-jest transformer.
This occurred after upgrading to TypeScript 5.x which changed module resolution.
Baseline tests confirmed this was a pre-existing issue.
Minimal fix: Added ts-jest devDependency and configured preset in jest.config.js.
Tests: Baseline test suite now passes (npm test)
```

### CI Repair Commit (Mode 2)

```
fix: <workflow-name> workflow broken (Fixes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>)

Mode: 2 (CI_REPAIR)
RCA: <3-5 line root cause>
Fix: <1-2 line description>
Protocol: <canary/pinned versions/etc>
```

**Example:**
```
fix: test workflow broken (Fixes #345)

Mode: 2 (CI_REPAIR)
RCA: GitHub Actions workflow test.yml was failing with "actions/checkout@v3
not found". Root cause: GitHub deprecated v3 on 2025-10-01. Workflow was
using unpinned version reference that auto-upgraded but v4 requires different
node version.
Fix: Pinned actions/checkout@v4.1.0 and updated node-version to 20.x.
Protocol: Tested in canary workflow first, pinned all action versions.
```

### Scoped Override Commit (Mode 3)

```
<type>: <short-name> (Fixes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>)

Mode: 3 (Scoped Override - Approved)
Approval: <approver> on <date>
RCA: <3-5 line root cause>
Fix: <1-2 line description>
Files: <list of modified files from PROPOSED_FILES.txt>
Tests: <test file path>
```

**Example:**
```
feat: add product image optimization (Fixes #456)

Mode: 3 (Scoped Override - Approved)
Approval: @tech-lead on 2025-10-14
RCA: Product gallery was serving unoptimized 3.2MB PNG images, causing
lighthouse score of 45/100. No existing optimization pipeline. Required
runtime dependency and root config modification.
Fix: Added next-image-optimizer, configured in next.config.ts, updated
ProductGallery component to use <Image> with WebP conversion.
Files: next.config.ts, package.json, src/components/ProductGallery.tsx
Tests: tests/components/ProductGallery.test.tsx
```
