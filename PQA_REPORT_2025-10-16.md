### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #2 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 10/10**  
**Severity: 5 (Critical)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 5 (Immediate)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-6 (Environment & Legacy Drift - Operational Risk)**  
**Area of Impact: Development Environment, CI/CD**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- Missing node_modules directory prevents all development, build, test, and lint commands from executing, completely blocking development workflow.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** The codebase has no `node_modules/` directory, causing all npm scripts to fail with "command not found" errors. This is a **critical feature velocity blocker** that prevents:
  - Type checking: `tsc: not found`
  - Linting: `next: not found`
  - Testing: `jest: not found`
  - Building: Cannot build for production
  - Development: Cannot start dev server
- **Root Cause:** Dependencies not installed. This suggests the remote environment is not properly initialized or the setup process was skipped.

- **Business Impact:** Complete development halt. No developer can work on this codebase without first diagnosing and fixing the environment setup.

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Commands Executed:**
  ```bash
  npm run type-check  # ‚Üí sh: 1: tsc: not found
  npm run lint        # ‚Üí sh: 1: next: not found
  npm test            # ‚Üí sh: 1: jest: not found
  du -sh node_modules # ‚Üí cannot access 'node_modules': No such file or directory
  ```
- **Exit Codes:** 127 (command not found)
- **File:** `package.json` declares dependencies, but they are not installed

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Small** (1 minute)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Any Developer / DevOps
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 0 (Environment Setup)
- **Action:** Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #3 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 8/10**  
**Severity: 4 (Major)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 4 (High)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-6 (Environment & Legacy Drift - Configuration Synchronization)**  
**Area of Impact: Project Structure, Build Configuration**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- Duplicate directory structure with both `/app/` and `/src/app/` containing different page content creates confusion and risks deployment errors.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** Next.js App Router expects pages in either `app/` or `src/app/`, not both. Having both directories with different content is a **major configuration drift** that causes:
  - **Confusion:** Developers don't know which directory is the source of truth
  - **Inconsistent Behavior:** `/app/page.tsx` has the full application UI, while `/src/app/page.tsx` has a placeholder "Welcome" page
  - **Risk of Deployment Errors:** Changes made to the wrong directory won't deploy
  - **Maintenance Burden:** Need to keep two directory structures in sync
- **Root Cause:** Likely a project restructuring that wasn't completed, or a migration from `app/` to `src/app/` (or vice versa) that left both directories in place.

- **Current State:**
  - `/app/page.tsx` (97 lines): Full tabbed application with Settings, News, Policy tabs
  - `/src/app/page.tsx` (15 lines): Simple "Welcome to News App" placeholder page

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Files:**
  - `/app/layout.tsx` - Active root layout
  - `/app/page.tsx` - Active main page (97 lines, full app)
  - `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Duplicate layout
  - `/src/app/page.tsx` - Placeholder page (15 lines)
- **Directory Listing:**
  ```
  /workspace/app/    # Contains: layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css
  /workspace/src/app/ # Contains: layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css
  ```
- **Behavior:** Next.js currently uses `/app/` (not in `src/`), making `/src/app/` dead code

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Medium** (15-30 minutes)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Frontend / Architecture Lead
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Refactoring)
- **Action:**
  1. Identify which directory is the source of truth (likely `/app/`)
  2. Delete the unused directory (likely `/src/app/`)
  3. Update documentation to clarify project structure
  4. Update `jest.config.js` if it references the deleted directory

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #4 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 7/10**  
**Severity: 3 (Medium)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 4 (High)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-1 (Code Scrutiny - Technical Debt & Quality)**  
**Area of Impact: Maintainability, Developer Friction**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- NewsTab.tsx (1070 lines) and SettingsTab.tsx (741 lines) are monolithic components that violate single-responsibility principle and cause excessive developer friction.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** These components are **massive monoliths** that violate the project's own code style guide (docs/CODE_STYLE.md line 598: "Components are reasonably sized (<300 lines)"). This creates:
  - **High Cognitive Load:** Developers must understand 1000+ lines to make changes
  - **Merge Conflict Risk:** Multiple developers editing the same large file
  - **Testing Difficulty:** Hard to write isolated unit tests
  - **Performance Risk:** Large components re-render entire trees
  - **Developer Friction Debt:** Every change requires understanding the entire component
- **Root Cause:** Features were incrementally added to these components without refactoring into smaller, composable pieces.

- **Code Style Guide Violation:** Per `docs/CODE_STYLE.md:598`, components should be "reasonably sized (<300 lines)". These components are **3.5x and 2.5x** over the limit.

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Files:**
  - `components/NewsTab.tsx:1070` - 1070 lines (257% over guideline)
  - `components/SettingsTab.tsx:741` - 741 lines (147% over guideline)
- **Metrics:**
  - Average component size: 282 lines (acceptable)
  - Total components: 13 files
  - These 2 files account for **49% of all component code** (1811/3668 lines)
- **Functions:** NewsTab contains multiple large nested functions (generateReport: ~400 lines, searchKeyword: ~270 lines)

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Large** (4-8 hours)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Frontend Engineer (React expertise)
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Major Refactoring)
- **Recommended Breakdown:**
  - **NewsTab.tsx** ‚Üí Extract: `GenerateReportForm`, `KeywordResultsList`, `Stage1ProgressBar`, `SuccessBanner`, `DateFilterWarning` components
  - **SettingsTab.tsx** ‚Üí Extract: `ApiKeySection`, `ModelSelectionSection`, `ModelParametersSection`, `KeywordsSection`, `SearchInstructionsSection` components

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #5 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 7/10**  
**Severity: 3 (Medium)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 4 (High)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-4 (Policy & Standard Violations)**  
**Area of Impact: Code Quality, Production Logs**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- 21 console.log/warn/error statements in production code violate code style guidelines and expose internal application behavior to end users.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** Per `docs/CODE_STYLE.md:596`, the code review checklist explicitly states "No console.logs (except intentional logging)". Console statements in production code:
  - **Expose Internal Logic:** Attackers can see search patterns, API call timing, error handling logic
  - **Performance Overhead:** Console operations can slow down production apps (especially in loops)
  - **Noise in Production Logs:** Makes it harder to find actual errors
  - **Not Configurable:** Cannot be turned off without code changes
- **Root Cause:** Debugging statements were left in during development and never removed.

- **Current Distribution:**
  - `components/NewsTab.tsx`: 20 console statements (log, warn, error)
  - `components/SettingsTab.tsx`: 1 console statement

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Search Pattern:** `console\.(log|warn|error|debug)`
- **Files:**
  - `components/NewsTab.tsx` - 20 instances throughout search and processing logic
  - `components/SettingsTab.tsx:176` - 1 instance in error handling
- **Examples:**
  ```typescript
  console.log(`[${keyword.text}] Starting search...`);
  console.log(`[${keyword.text}] Response received in ${time}s`);
  console.warn(`[${keyword.text}] ‚ùå Rejected (no date): ...`);
  console.error(`[${keyword.text}] API Error:`, data.error);
  ```

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Small** (30 minutes)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Frontend Engineer
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Code Cleanup)
- **Recommended Solution:**
  1. Remove all non-essential console statements
  2. For essential logging, replace with proper logging library (e.g., `loglevel`, `winston`)
  3. Add ESLint rule `no-console: "error"` to prevent future violations

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #6 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 6/10**  
**Severity: 3 (Medium)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 3 (Medium)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-1 (Code Scrutiny - Technical Debt)**  
**Area of Impact: Testing, Code Quality**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- Jest coverage thresholds are set at dangerously low levels (2% branches, 10% functions/lines/statements), providing minimal quality assurance.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** Test coverage thresholds in `jest.config.js` are set far below industry standards:
  - **Branches: 2%** (Industry standard: 80%+)
  - **Functions: 10%** (Industry standard: 80%+)
  - **Lines: 10%** (Industry standard: 80%+)
  - **Statements: 10%** (Industry standard: 80%+)
- **Impact:** With such low thresholds:
  - **No Safety Net:** 90% of code can be untested
  - **Regression Risk:** Changes can break features without test failures
  - **False Confidence:** CI passes even with minimal testing
  - **Technical Debt:** Harder to refactor without tests
- **Root Cause:** Thresholds likely set low during initial development and never raised as tests were added.

- **Current Test Suite:** Only 4 test files exist (`__tests__/*.test.ts`), suggesting actual coverage may be close to these low thresholds.

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **File:** `jest.config.js:24-30`
  ```javascript
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 2,      // Only 2% branch coverage required!
      functions: 10,    // Only 10% function coverage required!
      lines: 10,        // Only 10% line coverage required!
      statements: 10,   // Only 10% statement coverage required!
    }
  }
  ```
- **Test Files:** Only 4 test files for 24 source files (16.7% file coverage)
  - `__tests__/utils.test.ts` - Utils tested ‚úì
  - `__tests__/store.test.ts` - Store tested ‚úì
  - `__tests__/NewsTab.test.tsx` - NewsTab tested ‚úì
  - `__tests__/deployment-config.test.ts` - Config tested ‚úì
  - **Missing:** 0 tests for 9 other components

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Medium** (2-4 hours for threshold increase + monitoring)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** QA Engineer / Frontend Engineer
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Test Enhancement)
- **Recommended Approach:**
  1. Run `npm test -- --coverage` to get current baseline
  2. Incrementally raise thresholds (e.g., 50% ‚Üí 70% ‚Üí 80%) over multiple sprints
  3. Add tests for critical paths first (NewsTab, SettingsTab, store)
  4. Add tests for utility functions and UI components

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #7 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 5/10**  
**Severity: 2 (Minor)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 3 (Medium)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-5 (User Experience & Accessibility)**  
**Area of Impact: Accessibility, WCAG Compliance**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- Zero ARIA attributes found across all interactive components, failing WCAG 2.1 Level A accessibility requirements.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** The application has **no ARIA attributes** (aria-label, aria-describedby, aria-live, etc.) on any interactive elements, buttons, or form controls. This violates:
  - **WCAG 2.1 Level A:** Required for accessibility compliance
  - **Legal Risk:** May violate ADA/Section 508 requirements
  - **User Impact:** Screen reader users cannot navigate or understand the application
  - **Code Style Guide:** Per `docs/CODE_STYLE.md:600`, "Accessibility attributes added (aria-labels, etc.)" is a required checklist item
- **Affected Areas:** All tabs, buttons, forms, dynamic content updates, loading states lack proper ARIA annotations.

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Search Results:**
  - Pattern: `aria-` ‚Üí **0 matches** found in all `.tsx` files
  - Pattern: `role="button"|role="link"|tabindex` ‚Üí **0 matches**
  - Pattern: `<button.*onClick` ‚Üí **0 matches** (buttons exist, but no ARIA attributes)
- **Missing ARIA Attributes:**
  - No `aria-label` on icon-only buttons
  - No `aria-busy` on loading states
  - No `aria-live` regions for dynamic updates (report generation status)
  - No `aria-describedby` for form field help text
  - No `aria-expanded` on collapsible sections

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Medium** (4-6 hours)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Frontend Engineer (Accessibility knowledge)
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Enhancement)
- **Recommended Changes:**
  - Add `aria-label` to all icon buttons (e.g., "Delete keyword", "Toggle keyword")
  - Add `aria-busy="true"` to loading states
  - Add `aria-live="polite"` to report generation status area
  - Add `aria-expanded` to expandable keyword results
  - Add `aria-describedby` to form inputs with validation messages
  - Test with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS) to verify improvements

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #8 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 5/10**  
**Severity: 2 (Minor)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 3 (Medium)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-1 (Code Scrutiny - Missing Error Handling)**  
**Area of Impact: User Experience, Error Handling**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- No React Error Boundary implementation means unhandled component errors crash the entire application instead of showing a graceful fallback UI.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** The application has no Error Boundary components to catch and handle React errors. When any component throws an error:
  - **White Screen of Death:** Users see a blank page or crash message
  - **No Recovery:** Application state is lost
  - **Poor UX:** No guidance on what went wrong or how to recover
  - **Lost Context:** No error details captured for debugging
- **Root Cause:** Error boundaries were never implemented during initial development.

- **Recommended:** Add error boundaries around:
  - Each major tab (Settings, News, Policy)
  - The report generation workflow (high complexity, API-dependent)
  - Dynamic imports

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Search Results:**
  - Pattern: `componentDidCatch|ErrorBoundary|error-boundary` ‚Üí **0 matches** in codebase
  - No error boundary wrapper components found
- **High-Risk Components:**
  - `NewsTab.tsx` - Complex async operations, multiple API calls
  - `SettingsTab.tsx` - API validation, model fetching
  - `PolicyViewer.tsx` - Dynamically loaded content

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Small** (1-2 hours)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Frontend Engineer
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Feature Addition)
- **Recommended Implementation:**
  ```typescript
  // Create components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
  class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
      // Log to monitoring service
      // Show fallback UI
    }
  }
  // Wrap each tab in layout.tsx or page.tsx
  ```

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #9 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 5/10**  
**Severity: 3 (Medium)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 2 (Low)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-3 (Performance & Efficiency)**  
**Area of Impact: Build Performance, Developer Experience**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- No performance optimization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) found in large components, causing unnecessary re-renders and slow UI updates.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** Large components like NewsTab (1070 lines) and SettingsTab (741 lines) have no performance optimizations:
  - **Excessive Re-renders:** Parent state changes trigger full component re-renders
  - **Slow UI Updates:** List rendering (models, keywords, cards) not optimized
  - **Poor UX:** Lag during typing, filtering, or report generation
  - **Wasted CPU:** Expensive calculations repeated on every render
- **Root Cause:** Components prioritized functionality over performance during initial development.

- **Code Style Guide Reference:** Per `docs/CODE_STYLE.md:493-511`, the guide explicitly recommends React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for performance optimization.

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Search Results:**
  - Pattern: `React.memo|useMemo|useCallback` ‚Üí **0 matches** in component files
  - `NewsTab.tsx:1070` lines with no memoization
  - `SettingsTab.tsx:741` lines with no memoization
- **Unoptimized Operations:**
  - `NewsTab.tsx`: Card filtering/sorting on every render
  - `SettingsTab.tsx`: Model list filtering (potentially 100+ models) on every keystroke
  - `ActiveCardsTab.tsx`: Card sorting/grouping on every render

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Medium** (3-4 hours)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Frontend Engineer (React optimization)
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Performance Optimization)
- **Recommended Changes:**
  - Add `React.memo` to `NewsCard`, `ReportGroup`, model list items
  - Add `useMemo` for sorted/filtered lists in NewsTab and SettingsTab
  - Add `useCallback` for event handlers passed to child components
  - Consider virtualization (react-window) for long lists (models, cards)

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #10 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 5/10**  
**Severity: 2 (Minor)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 3 (Medium)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-2 (Log & Runtime Analysis)**  
**Area of Impact: API, Error Handling**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- No request timeout or retry logic for OpenRouter API calls, risking indefinite hangs and poor user experience on network issues.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** API calls to OpenRouter (fetch in NewsTab and SettingsTab) lack:
  - **Timeout:** Requests can hang indefinitely on slow networks
  - **Retry Logic:** Transient failures (503, network errors) immediately fail
  - **Exponential Backoff:** Retry storms can overload the API
  - **User Feedback:** No loading indicators or timeout messages
- **Current Behavior:**
  - NewsTab has a 30-second timeout for individual keyword searches (line 192-196)
  - SettingsTab API calls have **no timeout** (lines 77-82, 140-146)
  - No retry logic anywhere
- **Impact:** Users on slow connections or experiencing transient API issues get poor experience with no recovery options.

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Files:**
  - `components/NewsTab.tsx:191-196` - Has 30s timeout (good)
  - `components/SettingsTab.tsx:77` - No timeout in API key validation
  - `components/SettingsTab.tsx:140` - No timeout in model fetching
- **Timeout Implementation (NewsTab):**
  ```typescript
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(
      () => reject(new Error('Search timeout after 30 seconds')),
      30000
    );
  });
  const response = await Promise.race([fetchPromise, timeoutPromise]);
  ```
- **Missing in SettingsTab:** No similar timeout/retry mechanism

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Small** (1-2 hours)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Frontend Engineer
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Enhancement)
- **Recommended Solution:**
  1. Extract timeout logic to utility function `fetchWithTimeout(url, options, timeoutMs)`
  2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff (e.g., 3 retries with 1s, 2s, 4s delays)
  3. Apply to all API calls in SettingsTab
  4. Add clear timeout/error messages to UI

### üêõ NEW ISSUE PROPOSAL #11 (PQA Scan)

**Priority Score: 4/10**  
**Severity: 2 (Minor)** ¬∑ **Urgency: 2 (Low)**  
**Scanning Mode: S-4 (Policy & Standard Violations)**  
**Area of Impact: Documentation, Developer Experience**

**Summary (1 sentence):**

- Inconsistent JSDoc coverage (missing on 70%+ of functions) violates the project's documentation standards and harms code discoverability.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Why this is an issue:** Per `docs/CODE_STYLE.md:346-369`, "JSDoc Comments" are required for all public functions. However:
  - Only `lib/utils.ts` and `lib/store.ts` have comprehensive JSDoc
  - Component functions (NewsTab, SettingsTab, etc.) have minimal or no JSDoc
  - Event handlers, state updaters, and utility functions lack documentation
- **Impact:**
  - **Poor IDE Support:** No autocomplete documentation hints
  - **Harder Onboarding:** New developers must read implementation to understand usage
  - **Maintenance Burden:** Unclear function purposes lead to bugs
- **Root Cause:** Documentation was added to core libraries but not consistently applied to components.

**Evidence / Repro Steps:**

- **Files with Good JSDoc:**
  - `lib/utils.ts` - All functions documented with examples ‚úì
  - `lib/store.ts` - Interfaces and types documented ‚úì
- **Files with Missing JSDoc:**
  - `components/NewsTab.tsx` - Only high-level component comment, no function docs
  - `components/SettingsTab.tsx` - Only high-level component comment, no function docs
  - `components/ActiveCardsTab.tsx` - No JSDoc at all
  - `components/NewsCard.tsx` - No JSDoc at all
- **Code Style Guide:** `docs/CODE_STYLE.md:346-369` provides JSDoc templates with examples

**Estimated Fix Complexity:**

- **Medium** (2-3 hours)
- **Required Skillset/Team:** Any Developer
- **Estimated Fixing Mode:** Mode 3 (Documentation)
- **Recommended Approach:**
  1. Add JSDoc to all exported functions in components
  2. Document complex internal functions (e.g., generateReport, searchKeyword)
  3. Add @param and @returns tags with type information
  4. Add usage examples for non-obvious functions
  5. Enable ESLint rule `require-jsdoc` to enforce in future

1. **Pre-commit Hooks (Husky)**
   - Already configured in `package.json:14`
   - Ensure it blocks commits with:
     - Failing tests
     - ESLint errors
     - Type errors

2. **ESLint Rules (Add to .eslintrc.json)**

   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       "no-console": "error",
       "require-jsdoc": [
         "error",
         {
           "require": {
             "FunctionDeclaration": true,
             "ClassDeclaration": true
           }
         }
       ],
       "max-lines-per-function": ["warn", { "max": 100 }]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Automated Dependency Updates**
   - Use Dependabot or Renovate Bot
   - Auto-create PRs for security patches

4. **Accessibility Linting**
   - Install `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`
   - Add to ESLint config

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add React DevTools Profiler in development
   - Consider Lighthouse CI in deployment pipeline
